# Five-Stones

Five Stones is simple game that I created for an assignment for CPSC 1160 at Langara College. It is played on a board on the console where there are two players and they have to try and get a five-in-a-row. In this game, the use plays against an A.I. opponent that uses a simple minimax algorithm that plays defensively and tries to stop the user from making winning or close to winning moves while placing its own pieces in optimal positions when it can.
