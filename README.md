# Five-Stones

Five Stones is simple game that I created for an assignment for CPSC 1160: Algorithms and Data Structures I at Langara College. It is played on a board on the console where there are two players and they have to try and get a five-in-a-row. In this game, the user plays against an A.I. opponent that uses a simple minimax algorithm that plays defensively and tries to stop the user from making winning or close to winning moves while placing its own pieces in optimal positions when it can.

The user selects a position for a stone by entering in the column and row where they would like to place the stone and the A.I. places its stone afterwards. This continues until either side wins or a stalemate forms.
